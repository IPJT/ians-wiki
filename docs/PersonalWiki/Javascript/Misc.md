## The difference between || (logical or operator) and ?? (nullish coalescing operator) operators in Javascript & NodeJS

In short, the difference between the two operators comes down to the difference between falsy and null/undefined. The nullish coalescing operator (??) takes the right operand only when the left side is set to null or undefined whereas the the logical or operator (||) takes the right operand in the case of a falsy value â€” which includes empty string, 0, false, NaN, etc. Having said that, we could think of the ?? operator as subset of the ||.
